I'm a first year PhD student at Stockholm University supervised by [Markus Hausmann](https://staff.math.su.se/markus.hausmann/).
Before that, I finished my master's degree at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin supervised by [Gabriel Angelini-Knoll](https://www.gangeliniknoll.com/).
Before that, I was an undergrad in mathematics and physics at KU Leuven.

My research interests include

-Equivariant and global homotopy theory, equivariant generalisations of chromatic homotopy theory, equivariant formal group laws.

-K-theory, motivic cohomology, trace methods, prismatic cohomology.
