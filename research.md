Here are my past and current research projects.

- **Deformations of stable homotopy theory**

  This was my master's thesis in which I looked at a filtered model for synthetic spectra as defined by Piotr Pstr\k{a}gowski in [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01804.pdf).
  The thesis attempts to construct a universal property for these as a deformation of spectra with a given algebraic fibre, in terms of filtered spectra.
