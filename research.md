#### Here are my past and current research projects.
- **An equivariant Adams spectral sequence based on MO**

  My current PhD project. The global spectrum $\mathbf{MO}$ for elementary abelian 2-groups represent the universal equivariant 2-torsion global group law. Further, at the trivial group is associated Hopf algebroid is equivalent to the classical Adams hopf algebroid based on $\mathbb{F}_2$. Their $E_2$-pages are related by a series of Bockstein spectral sequences, which give us a systematic way to produce classes in an equivariant analogue of the Adams $E_2$-page.

- **Deformations of stable homotopy theory**

  This was my master's thesis in which I looked at a filtered model for synthetic spectra.
  The thesis attempts to construct a universal property for these as a deformation of spectra with a given algebraic fibre, in terms of filtered spectra. (pdf forthcoming)
