# Notes

![moss](DSC_6077.JPG)

#### Here are some notes for talks I've given that might be useful.

- **Motivic precursors to synthetic spectra.**

  These notes are for a talk in a [reading seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/synthetic-spectra-seminar/) on synthetic spectra at Stockholm University,   In which I introduced the motivic stable homotopy category to homotopy theorists and outlined some key points of the theory of cellular motivic spectra     over the complex numbers. [pdf](./motivic precursors writeup.pdf)

- **The motivic filtration on topological periodic homology.**

  These notes are for a talk in the [Oberseminar](https://hoyois.app.uni-regensburg.de/WS23/prismatic/index.html) on absolute prismatic comohlogy at the      University of Regensburg. I discuss the motivic filtration on topological periodic homology and related invariants as described in work of Bhatt--Lurie,    and use it along with the HKR filtration to construct global prismatic complexes. (pdf forthcoming)
