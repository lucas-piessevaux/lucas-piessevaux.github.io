# Notes

![moss](DSC_6077.JPG)

#### Here are some notes I've written down that might be useful.

- **Motivic precursors to synthetic spectra.**

  These notes are for a talk in a [reading seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/synthetic-spectra-seminar/) on synthetic spectra at Stockholm University,   In which I introduced the motivic stable homotopy category to homotopy theorists and outlined some key points of the theory of cellular motivic spectra     over the complex numbers.

- **Rigid analytic coordinates on the stack of one-dimensional formal groups.**

  This is a translation of a [preprint](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~laurent.fargues/Chromatique.pdf) by Laurent Fargues (accessed 2024-04-08) on a new rigid analytic description of the overconvergent generic fibre of the mooduli stack of one-dimensional formal groups of finite height. In particular, expressing it as a quotient of a finite dimensional projective space by a group action. The original is in French. [pdf](./Fargues_chromatic_translation.pdf)
