# Notes

Here are some notes for talks I've given that might be useful.

- [**Motivic precursors to synthetic spectra.**](./motivic precursors writeup.pdf)

These notes are for a talk in a [reading seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/synthetic-spectra-seminar/) on synthetic spectra at Stockholm University, In which I introduced the motivic stable homotopy category to homotopy theorists and outlined some key points of the theory of cellular motivic spectra over the complex numbers.
