- **Reading seminar: Motivic homotopy theory**
  [Fabio Neugebauer](https://fneugebauer.github.io/) and I will be organising a reading seminar on motivic homotopy theory, starting from scratch and covering the Hopkins—Morel—Hoyois theorem among others. Details forthcoming

***SoSe 25, Bonn***

- **Graduate Seminar on Topology: Tensor-triangular Geometry**

  [Markus Hausmann](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/hausmann/) and I are organising a reading seminar on tt-geometry. The syllabus can be found [here](./tt_geometry_syllabus.pdf).
